# AppExample
 MVC ASP.NET Core with Razor and Bootstrap/JQuery/Ajax as a FrontEnd calling WebAPI .NET Core as Backend, using C# 6.0.
 This is a project for study purpose, so we used generic entities, but have all things that a big or commercial project have.

The FrontEnd could be changed for others technologies, such as ReactJS, that we want to do for the next step. 

So we have developed until now was developed in 24 hours or 3 days with 8 hours each and this was one of the challenges that we had. So it has somethings that I know could be better, but because of the short time challenge I developed like the way it is.

For the next step I pretend to develop the frontend in just 12 hours, then I need to study a little bit more to do this in a short time.

And why I am doing these project in a short time, because I want to challenge myself and because I dont have much time to do these development study things.
